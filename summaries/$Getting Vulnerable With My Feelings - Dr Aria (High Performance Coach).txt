                    CHAPTER: Intuition vs rationalisation
                    -------------------------------------
                     - Prioritize intuition as well as rationality.

- Pay attention to feelings of alignment or discomfort, even if you can't fully explain them.
- Consider both the potential benefits and risks before making decisions.
- Allow your intuition and values to guide you, while also using your mind to rationalize and justify those choices.

                    CHAPTER: Intuition evolves into change
                    -------------------------------------
                     - Intuition is influenced by one's state of consciousness and clarity of vision.
- Being open and free from mental filters allows for a more sensitive and appropriate response to situations.
- Acting from a place of intuition may not always mean doing the same thing; being aware of what feels true and right is crucial.
- When making decisions, finding stillness and clarity can help determine the best course of action.
- Pay attention to what the mind tells you about your values (e.g., valuing depth, connection, and beauty).
- Express your truth authentically while considering others' feelings.
- Take action based on your truth, pause, observe reactions, and adjust accordingly.

                    -------------------------------------
                    CHAPTER: Fear as a core value
                    -------------------------------------
                     - Identify an aspirational identity and corresponding core values (in this case, "share without fear").
- Recognize and acknowledge feelings of fear.
- Understand that resistance to fear can lead to paralysis.
- Welcome and accept the presence of fear rather than trying to reject or ignore it.
- Embrace the human experience, including both positive and negative emotions.
- Focus on taking desired actions despite the presence of fear.
- Reflect on other situations in which you may be placing unhelpful expectations on yourself regarding certain emotional responses.

                    -------------------------------------
                    CHAPTER: When reality clashes with expectation
                    -------------------------------------
                     Actionable points:

1. Recognize that "should" is a fabrication of the mind and often leads to suffering.
2. The world is unfolding on its own; trying to control it according to expectations causes misery.
3. Values and qualities you desire (e.g., courage, authenticity) are inherent within you; remove mental blocks to let them flow through.
4. Be cautious of the language used; instead of aspirations, see existing qualities within yourself.
5. Let go of rigid identities and attachments to beliefs; adopt them loosely, like clothing worn for specific occasions.
6. Embrace consciousness, which cannot be defined or limited by labels or boxes.
7. Consider eliminating the word "should" from your vocabulary, replacing it with alternatives like "would like to" or "have the option of choosing."
8. Experience life directly without constantly evaluating events based on impact on others.
9. Connect to the internal intuitive place of what you would truly love happening, leading to following your truth despite potential fears.

                    -------------------------------------
                    CHAPTER: Pleasure vs joy
                    -------------------------------------
                     - Distinguish between pleasure (driven by the mind) and joy (deeper, possibly involving hardship).
- Notice when the mind seeks pleasure or addiction versus when the heart is open.
- Recognize that the mind focuses on external factors for survival, while true happiness and peace come from within.
- Consider whether you truly want material possessions or achievements, or if you simply desire the feelings associated with them (peace, contentment, etc.).
- Determine if you prefer a "lifestyle business" (fewer employees, flexibility, lower stress) or a "performance business" (more employees, scalability, potentially higher revenue).
- Be aware of societal pressures to scale and grow, and question whether such expectations align with your personal goals and values.
- Learn to distinguish between genuine internal desires and external influences driving your aspirations.

                    -------------------------------------
                    CHAPTER: The mind thinks, the heart knows
                    -------------------------------------
                     - Consider renting a Porsche instead of buying one, to satisfy the desire for the driving experience without the attachment of ownership.
- Recognize attachments (beliefs that certain things will bring happiness) and question whether they align with true sources of joy.
- Focus on the "inner game" - personal growth, self-awareness, and contentment - to prevent gaining external success at the expense of emotional wellbeing.
- Remember that material possessions and social status may not lead to genuine happiness, as depicted in various religious texts and real-life examples.
- Seek truth and base decisions on that foundation, allowing other aspects of life to fall into place naturally.

                     - Begin to notice when there's a block or if you're moving from a place of fear.
- Create space for introspection and solitude.
- Slow down and allow brilliant ideas to flow through you.
