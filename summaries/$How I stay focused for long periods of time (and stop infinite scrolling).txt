 Actionable points:

1. Remove outer distractions such as turning off your phone or putting it in another room. Consider using a "dumb phone" to prevent infinite scrolling.
2. Address inner distractions by identifying the source of discomfort, writing down triggers and sensations, and waiting 10 minutes before giving in to the distraction. This will help break the habit of infinite scrolling and train your brain to stay focused.
3. Implement deep work sessions of 50-90 minutes, during which you train yourself to be indistractable. Use a visual timer to keep track of time remaining in each session.
4. Set an implementation intention by writing down exactly when and what you will do. This increases the likelihood of following through with planned actions.
5. Optimize your energy levels by managing sleep, diet, exercise, and stress. Take advantage of your natural highs and lows throughout the day based on your chronotype.
6. Meditate consistently to improve focus and reduce distractions. Mindfulness meditation is particularly effective for increasing gray matter in the brain and changing brain waves.
7. Create a consistent routine before beginning focused work. Having a regular workspace can also contribute to increased focus and productivity.
