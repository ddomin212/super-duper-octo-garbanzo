                    -------------------------------------

- When promoting a product or service, consider manually reaching out to individual contacts (as done via WhatsApp broadcast lists) instead of relying solely on automated methods.

- Develop a sense of familiarity when networking, similar to communicating with friends. Share valuable resources directly and candidly rather than formally introducing content.

                     - It took 3.5 years for the show's growth to take off, with a significant increase after being featured on the Joe Rogan show.
- Stick with your efforts as the value of each unit increases over time (compounding).
- Enjoy what you're doing or continue doing it regardless of external recognition.
- Consistent effort leads to success; example of starting with 100k downloads per episode and decreasing to 7k while focusing on other projects, but still considering it a win.
- Be patient and consistent; slow and steady growth can lead to substantial results over time.
- Less aggression in leadership and business strategy can result in long-term sustainability, similar to running a marathon instead of sprinting.
- Presume you will be doing what you're currently working on for another 10 years, ensuring longevity and persistence.
- Start now - many people never begin due to fear or hesitation. Find the intersection between passion and utility.

                    -------------------------------------
                     Actionable points:

- Look for patterns among successful billionaires, such as finding a niche they truly believe in and focusing solely on that (e.g., John Paul DeJoria with Paul Mitchell Hair Care and Patrón tequila).
- Persist in selling your product or service, even during slow periods; building a strong "reorder" business is crucial.
- Don't rely on luck alone - actively work towards increasing your chances of success through consistent effort and networking (like John Paul DeJoria did by persisting in selling Patrón tequila until it gained popularity).
- When you achieve financial success, consider giving back authentically, as DeJora did by immediately donating $50 million upon selling his company.
- Strive for balance and satisfaction in various aspects of life instead of constantly chasing more wealth or status, avoiding the trap of discontentment that many billionaires fall into.
